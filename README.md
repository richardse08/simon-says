Replica of the Simon Says game

This game will be function intensive and should show solid understanding of object-oriented and functional programming

UPDATE 290517
Made substantial progress today. While testing, was able to code up some functions (they may be archived in functions.js) that would run through a practice list and correctly make a noise and flash a color correlated to a randomly selected corner. Also, was able to create an interval script that would ensure some time elapsed between showing user this. As of now, if you click start the program will choose a random spot. If you choose the same spot, itll continue and create a another random spot. If you choose the wrong spot then it will alert(you lose). 

Need to create code to chain the moves together, also need to add a strict mode
